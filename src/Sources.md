# Sources of stuff

Image icons are found on their respective pages [here](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Item_(League_of_Legends))
Training Dummy Square located in the TFT set 6 area

Champion Squares found at [fandom wiki](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki)(.webp, preferred due to lower file sizes), or [cdragon](https://raw.communitydragon.org/latest/plugins/rcp-be-lol-game-data/global/default/v1/champion-icons/)(.png)

Missing something? Try the fandom wiki or [riot api Data Dragon](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ddragon.html) first(but if you're looking for stat icons, it's only got the rune shard ones).


### Icons:
Icons used are based off of the icons used in game. I unfortunately couldn't find the icons used in an icon format, and having 14px by 14px images is not optimal, so I made 64px ones.
During the rebuilding of this project from Unity C# to React ts, I have converted the pixel art into SVGs- these are not 100% accurate, but they're close enough.

###	Text Colors:
Text colors are gotten from either color picking screenshots or utilizing the icon colors... and thus aren't 100% accurate.
