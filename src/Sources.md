# Sources of stuff

Image icons are found on their respective pages [here](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Item_(League_of_Legends))
Training Dummy Square located in the TFT set 6 area

Champion Squares found [here](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Champion_Square_Images)

### Icons:
Icons used are based off of the icons used in game. I unfortunately couldn't find the icons used in an icon format, and having 14px by 14px images is not optimal, so I made 64px ones.
During the rebuilding of this project from Unity C# to React ts, I have converted the pixel art into SVGs

###	Text Colors:
Text colors are gotten from either color picking screenshots or utilizing the icon colors... and thus aren't 100% accurate.
